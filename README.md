# U-1F30F

Hi! Welcome to U-1F30F. In case you are wondering, U-1F30F is the unicode of earth globe emoji üåè. This is the project I'm using to mark the incredible moments of my travel memory.

The project is developed based on an open source project by [REDAXO](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/community). Check out REDAXO community's GitHub page for more details.
